# Autogenerated files by Pub
pubspec.lock # Pub caches dependencies here, but you might want to keep this for exact dependency versions for reproducible builds.
             # If you want to allow everyone to use the latest compatible versions, you can ignore it.
             # Most Flutter projects *do* commit pubspec.lock to ensure reproducible builds across environments.
             # So, consider whether you really want to ignore this. Usually, it's not ignored.
